Pong Game (Python)

This is a classic Pong game built using Python's Turtle Graphics module. The game features two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoreboard, allowing two players to compete against each other in a fun, retro-style game. Players control their paddles with the keyboard to try to keep the ball in play and score points by getting past their opponent.
Features:

    Two Player Mode: Players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen using the keyboard.
        Right Paddle: Use the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to move.
        Left Paddle: Use the "W" (up) and "S" (down) keys to move.
    Ball Movement: The ball bounces off walls and paddles.
    Scoring System: Points are scored when the ball crosses the screen past a paddle, and the scoreboard updates accordingly.
    Classic Gameplay: The game keeps running until the window is closed, with players trying to outscore each other.

Technologies Used:

    Python: Core programming language.
    Turtle Graphics: Used for creating the graphical interface and animations.
